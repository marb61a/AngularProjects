Angular 
    - Install cli  by using -> npm install -g @angular/cli
    - Generate a new project -> ng new <app-name>
    - CD into the app and then ng-serve to start
        - App will run on http://localhost:4200/ 
    - Updating version of angular can be also done at the cli
        - ng update @angular/core @angular/cli
    - It is good practice to regularly update Angular
    - Install the TSLint extension on VSCode
        - There are 2 but 1 is deprecated
    - Components can be generated using the cli
        - ng generate component <component>
        - This will generate a component folder in the src/app folder
        - To generate in a specific components folder use -> ng generate component components/<component>
    - To change from using css to using sass
        - ng config schematics.@schematics/angulare:component.styletext scss
        - Will need to change angular.json so that it reads
            "@schematics/angular:component": {
                "style": "scss"
            }
        - Also in order to use sass the component will have to be deleted and then regenerated
        - styles.css will have to be renamed to .scss as will the values in the angular.json file
